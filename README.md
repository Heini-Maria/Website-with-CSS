# Website-with-CSS
 
Brainnest front-end development course project. The purpose of this assignment was to create a static multi-page website with CSS styling following the given design for the home page. The content and the other pages' styling were defined. This exercise gave me a lot of extra practice with CSS styling, especially using flexbox.
